this is karthik's idea where we can have a loading page similar to this https://    www.therafaelbk.com/ and a hero section that takes up the entire screen so height: 100vh and also when we scroll the next image and text will come up. 

after this we can have our project section where there is a background transistion similar to this website https://my-portfolio-zeta-five-70.vercel.app/ from light to dark theme and also the projects section can look similar to this https://my-portfolio-zeta-five-70.vercel.app/ 

the next section is about us and we can use this https://yasio.dev/ for insiperation and i think its just an image and since we do have to make 2 about us section we can use the same transistion from the hero card and use it here

the next section must be testimonials which we can have the same one as the mentors section in deep-ai.com which we made 

for contact us i still dont have any idea and the same for footer also I'm still looking for the color pallets.
